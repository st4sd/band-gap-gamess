     Also should perform any operations required for the restart to work.
     Examples of common requirements
     - update input files options
     - rename output files of previous run to prevent overwriting (the `restarts` parameter is useful for this)
   Any files created/renamed/moved must be in the workingDir or subdirs
    Parameters:
        workingDirectory: Workflow directory of the component to be restarted
        restarts: The number of times this function has been called for this component
        componentName: The label the workflow engine uses to id this component
        log: A logiging.logger object - use to write output messages
        exitReason: A string. Defines why the components program exited.
                  One of the values in the experiment.codes.exitReasons dictionary
        exitCode: A integer. The exit-code returned by the components program
    Returns:
        True if the component can be restarted
        False if the function can't be restarted (for any reason)
